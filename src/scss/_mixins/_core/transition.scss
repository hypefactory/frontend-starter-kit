Transition mixin
=========================================
The mixins provides you a cross-browser compatible method to set a transition.
Please refer to <http://caniuse.com/css-transitions> to see the browser support table of the feature.
######Example:
`@include transition([property], [duration-value], [easing]);`
`$param: {String} properties: The properites which should be animated (Default: all)`<br/>
`$param: {String} duration: Duration of the transition including the unit (Default: 0.3s)`<br/>
`$param: {String} easing: The easing which should be used for the transition (Default: ease-out)`
*/

@mixin transition($transition: all 0.3s ease-out){
  -webkit-transition: $transition;
  transition: $transition;
}

@mixin transition-property($property){
  -webkit-transition-property: $property;
  transition-property: $property;
}

@mixin transition-duration($duration){
  -webkit-transition-duration: $duration;
  transition-duration: $duration;
}

@mixin transition-timing-function($timing){
  -webkit-transition-timing-function: $timing;
  transition-timing-function: $timing;
}

@mixin transition-delay($delay){
  -webkit-transition-delay: $delay;
  transition-delay: $delay;
}
